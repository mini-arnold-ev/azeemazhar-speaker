But it might also narrow the frontier of discovery.</h2> <div class="space-y-5 text-body leading-relaxed"> <p>Here&#39;s the central economic puzzle of our time. Population growth stalled in the 1950s. Idea generation — which depends on people — slowed with it. Economic growth has been coasting on the accumulated momentum of the post-war baby boom and the computing revolution. The engine is decelerating. And then, quite suddenly, AI arrives with a proposition that changes the equation entirely: what if labour could be *accumulated*?</p><p>Throughout human history, labour has been the one input to production that couldn&#39;t be stockpiled. You can accumulate capital — build factories, hoard gold, invest in bonds. You can accumulate resources — fill warehouses, secure supply chains, build reserves. But you can&#39;t stockpile human thinking. People go home. They retire. They forget. The production function of civilisation has always had this fundamental asymmetry.</p> </div> <div class="mt-8"> <a href="/azeemazhar-speaker/perspectives/from-exponential-to-infinite.md/" class="link-subtle text-small">

Between 2010 and 2017, three fundamental inputs to human civilisation — energy, intelligence, and biology — each independently crossed from extraction regimes to engineering regimes. Solar costs fell 99.6%, from $106 per watt to $0.38. The Transformer architecture made intelligence scalable. Genomic sequencing collapsed from $3 billion to a few thousand dollars. These aren&#39;t incremental improvements. They&#39;re phase transitions.</p><p>What does that mean in plain language?

It felt like a toy — a clever autocomplete that occasionally surprised me. By mid-2025, I was at a million tokens daily. AI had become a colleague: drafting, researching, challenging my assumptions. In February 2026, I hit 97,045,322 tokens in a single day. Cost: under $100. At that scale, AI isn&#39;t a tool or a colleague. It&#39;s a workforce.</p><p>Like the Eames&#39; famous film *Powers of Ten*, adding a zero doesn&#39;t just mean &quot;more.&quot; It changes what kind of thing you&#39;re looking at.
