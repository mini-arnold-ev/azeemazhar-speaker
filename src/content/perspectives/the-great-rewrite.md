Here's something that should unsettle every strategist in the room. Between 2010 and 2017, three fundamental inputs to human civilisation — energy, intelligence, and biology — each independently crossed from extraction regimes to engineering regimes. Solar costs fell 99.6%, from $106 per watt to $0.38. The Transformer architecture made intelligence scalable. Genomic sequencing collapsed from $3 billion to a few thousand dollars. These aren't incremental improvements. They're phase transitions.

What does that mean in plain language? It means civilisation is upgrading its operating system.

For centuries, we've run on what I call "Scarcity OS" — an operating system built around finding and controlling finite resources. Oil fields. Ore deposits. Rare talent. The entire architecture of modern institutions — corporate hierarchies, competitive strategy, regulatory frameworks, even the way we credential expertise — was designed for a world where the critical inputs were scarce and getting scarcer.

That world is ending. We've entered a regime of learning curves, where the critical inputs get cheaper and more abundant the more we use them. Solar follows Wright's Law: every doubling of cumulative production drops costs by roughly 20%. Intelligence follows scaling laws. Biology follows sequencing cost curves. Sixty-six technologies, tracked over ninety years, show the same pattern.

The implications are structural, not cosmetic.

At Davos last year, I watched three archetypes collide. The Hoarders — playing zero-sum games, trying to lock up resources and control access. The Managers — well-intentioned redistributors, moving deck chairs. And the Builders — the ones who recognise that when inputs become abundant, the game changes from division to creation. The loudest voices in public discourse are Hoarders. The most respectable are Managers. The Builders are too busy building to fight the political battle.

Here's the practical consequence. Dave Clark, the former CEO of Amazon's consumer business, built a functioning CRM in a weekend using AI agents. My own organisation, Exponential View, runs on a dozen custom applications that might have cost a million pounds to build traditionally. We spent roughly £500. The knowledge asymmetry that built the entire SaaS industry — vendors knew how to build software, customers knew what they needed — has collapsed. Domain knowledge is now the scarce resource, not engineering capacity.

This isn't a story about technology companies. It's a story about every company.

If your competitive strategy assumes that talent is scarce and getting scarcer, you're running Scarcity OS. If your org chart assumes that execution is expensive and coordination is cheap, you're running Scarcity OS. If your regulatory framework assumes that access to energy, intelligence, or biological tools is naturally limited, you're running Scarcity OS.

The companies that see this shift aren't just adopting AI. They're rewriting the logic of their entire business — their cost structures, their talent models, their assumptions about what's possible. The ones that don't see it are optimising yesterday's operating system with ever-greater efficiency, which is precisely the wrong response to a platform shift.

The question isn't whether your industry will be rewritten. It's whether you'll be the one holding the pen.
